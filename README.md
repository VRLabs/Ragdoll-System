## How it works

[World Physics](https://github.com/VRLabs/World-Physics) enables you to ragdoll your avatar and collide with the world.

## Install guide

Place the Ragdoll.cs script on your avatar and change any settings. Some settings have tooltips for explanation. Click "Generate Ragdoll System".

If needed, adjust the colliders after generation using their "Edit Collider" buttons.

Your ragdoll may slightly bounce or jitter locally. Other players do not see this.

If you checked 'Sound on collision' but later change the order of the layers in your FX controller, run the [Layer Weight Tool](https://github.com/VRLabs/Layer-Weight-Tool/) to correctly retarget layer 'ragdollCollide'. Open VRLabs from the menu bar. Click "Apply Weight Controls".
